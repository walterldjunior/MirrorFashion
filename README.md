### e-Commerce Mirror-Fashion


Layout design and operation of a simple e-commerce, focused primarily on HTML , CSS and JS.


I will use `mirror-dev` as development and `master` as production environment.

HTML, CSS* and JS according to semantic web rules by W3C: http://www.w3c.br/Padroes/WebSemantica

*CSS here was done based on the ideas implemented by Trello team, as described in this guide : https://gist.github.com/bobbygrace/9e961e8982f42eb91b80
